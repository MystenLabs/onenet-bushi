# Bushi Game smart contracts

This is an implementation of an NFT battle pass and an NFT cosmetic skin for the game Bushi developed by Onenet.

We are building a smart contract so that:
- the battle pass progress of a user can be recorded on-chain
- a cosmetic skin can be an NFT which is stored and can be updated on-chain
